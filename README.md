# SpectralMethodsInJulia
This is julia implementation of the book by Lloyd N. Trefethen "Specral Methods in MATLAB".
The code is in `Pluto.jl` notebook format, which can be run with `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto"); using Pluto; Pluto.run()` in julia REPL.

I organize related programs and relevant exercise in one file. Feel free to play with it!
